# Visualization using Earthquake data
  The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the  impacts   of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about     the Earth and its processes.
  
 
### Level 1: Basic Visualization

  First task is to visualize an earthquake data set.Here we will try to visualize earthquakes for past 7 days as published from USGS site.
  ## 1. Get the data set We will choose the 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', the site will be provide a JSON representation of that          data.The URL will be used to pull in the JSON data for our visualization.
  
  ## 2. Import & Visualize the Data**

   * Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should           appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
